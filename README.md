## ðŸ§© Feature Engineering  

Following the exploratory analysis, a detailed [**Feature Engineering Specification**](feature_engineering/feature_specification.md) was created to define the new variables and data transformations used in the modeling phase.  

This document outlines how raw customer attributes are enriched into meaningful predictors â€” such as **tenure groups**, **service counts**, **payment behavior**, and **engagement features** â€” that capture key churn patterns observed during EDA.  

Each feature is documented with its **definition**, **business rationale**, and **expected impact on churn**, ensuring transparency and reproducibility throughout the data pipeline.
